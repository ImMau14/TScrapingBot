## Data and Privacy

### Data and Experience

* For the history and language of Gemini's responses to function correctly, the user needs to be registered in the database to obtain their preferred language before generating the response.

* To maintain threads in different chats, it is necessary to save the chat ID, as TScrapingBot uses it to recognize where it is responding.

* In order to remember past conversations, the input and output messages of the bot are saved.

* The user is registered once they execute `/ask` or `/search`.

### Integrity

The data will not be shared with third parties or used for any purpose other than the development and functionalities of TScrapingBot.
